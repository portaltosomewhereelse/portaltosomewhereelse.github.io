Portal is an interactive projection. The goal of this project has been to provide a platform for anyone to explore some of the mathematics that have been used to model various scientific phenomena across disciplines without having to know any math or recognize any of the symbols involved. Mathematically, the projection is based on a system of partial differential equations incorporating reaction, diffusion, forcing (via input from a webcam) and symmetry. Parameters of this system are controlled by potentiometers attached to a podium. The podium itself is lined with hundreds of programmable led's that also react to changing parameters. The challenge has been to create something stimulating enough to capture the attention of individuals while also effectively communicating to these individuals what it is that they are interacting with.
